Human Origins genotype dataset for Lazaridis et al. (2014)
----------------------------------------------------------

There are three main datasets in this release:

release.* includes all individuals (including WGA ones and those dropped from the dataset during curation)
data.* is the curated dataset used for all analyses in Lazaridis et al. (2014). It includes terse names for populations (e.g., "Spanish")
vdata.* is the same as data.*, but it includes verbose names for populations (e.g., "Spanish_Andalucia_IBS", "Spanish_Aragon_IBS", etc.)

Each dataset consists of three files in PACKEDANCESTRYMAP format:
.geno	Genotype file
.ind	Individual file
.snp 	SNP file

These can be used with standard tools (e.g., ADMIXTOOLS, EIGENSOFT, ALDER, MixMapper) or converted to other formats using the "convertf" utility of EIGENSOFT (http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/alkes-price/software/).

There are also thirteen panels in directories panel*/ for thirteen different ascertainments as discussed in Patterson et al. 2012:

Panel#	Ascertainment
1	French
2	Han
3	Papuan1
4	San
5	Yoruba
6	Mbuti
7	Karitiana
8	Sardinian
9	Melanesian
10	Cambodian
11	Mongolian
12	Papuan2
13	Denisova-San

The "Stuttgart" early European farmer is labeled LBK380 in these datasets.

More information can be found in Supplementary Information, section 9 of Lazaridis et al. (2014). 
The full dataset used for analysis includes some additional populations; please consult Supplementary Information, section 9 of Lazaridis et al. (2014) for information on how to obtain this.
